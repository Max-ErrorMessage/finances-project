# finances-project
Uses a MS Acess Database and Python 3.8.1 to keep track of finances for multiple people

This is my first project that I am uploading to GitHub. 
I originally created this program to track and display my spending after I moved to University and wanted to be financially aware of where exaclty I was spending my money.
I expanded the program to allow for use by multiple people and added features to that extent. 
This is very much a beginner - level project.

Any critisism is very welcome.
